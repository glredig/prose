    <h4>Molecular Biologist Turned Writer</h4>

    <p>
      I have a strong science background. I have a Masters of Clinical Research, and a PhD in Molecular and 
      Medical Genetics from OHSU. My professional area of research expertise is genetics and clinical research 
      (epidemiology). However, I enjoy keeping up with and writing about an array of technical and scientific 
      topics – I love learning new things!
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a strong communication background. As a graduate student I won numerous awards for my 
      scientific talks. After completing my dissertation, I became an Oral Communications tutor at Stanford 
      University. There I helped a wide-variety of graduate students and post-docs communicate their 
      science. This work strengthened my own communication skills, made me realize how much I enjoy 
      communicating science, and inspired me to pursue my current profession as a writer/editor.

    <p>
      I have worked as a featured author for BitesizeBio. And currently, I work as an Editor for two of 
      BitesizeBio’s technical channels: their Protein Analysis, Detection & Assay channel, and their Microscopy 
      & Imaging channel. There I am in charge of recruiting, training, scheduling, and managing a small team 
      of writers and their content.

    <p>
      My passion is delivering highly-technical material in an accurate, but friendly and easy-to-follow 
      manner. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any writing/editing or tutoring needs. Be sure to 
      follow me on twitter, check out my linkedin, and like my facebook page.
